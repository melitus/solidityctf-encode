# Expert Solidity Bootcamp with Encode

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/melitus/solidityctf-encode.git
cd solidityctf-encode
forge build
```

### Optional Gitpod

If you can't or don't want to run and install locally, you can work with this repo in Gitpod. If you do this, you can skip the `clone this repo` part.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-smart-contract-lottery-f23)

# Usage

## Start a local node

```
make anvil
```

## Library

If you're having a hard time installing the chainlink library, you can optionally run this command. 

```
forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.6.1 --no-commit
```

## Deploy

This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

```
make deploy-sepolia contract=<CONTRACT_NAME>

```
For example:
```
make deploy-sepolia contract=PriceFeedConsumer
```
## Deploy - Other Network

[See below](#deployment-to-a-testnet-or-mainnet)

## Testing

We talk about 4 test tiers in the video.

1. Unit
2. Integration
3. Forked
4. Staging

This repo we cover #1 and #3.

```
forge test
```

or

```
forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

### Test Coverage

```
forge coverage
```

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

Optionally, add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

1. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some testnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

2. Deploy

```
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

## Scripts

After deploying to a testnet or local net, you can run the scripts.

Using cast deployed locally example:

```
cast send <RAFFLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "enterRaffle()" --value 0.1ether --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see an output file called `.gas-snapshot`

# Formatting

To run code formatting:

```
forge fmt
```

# Generate UML class diagram with sol2uml

To run code:

```
sol2uml ./src/Counter.sol 
```

# Slither for static analysis

To run code:

```

Contract Summary: Output a quick summary of the contract.
slither /src/nameOftheContract.sol --print contract-summary


Human Summary: Print a human-readable summary of the contracts
slither /src/nameOftheContract.sol --print human-summary


```

## Function Summary: Output a summary of the contract showing for each function:

- What are the visibility and the modifiers
- What are the state variables read or written
- What are the ca
```
slither /src/Counter.sol --print function-summary

```
# Call Graph: Export the call-graph of the contracts to a dot file.
```
slither /src/NameOfTheContract.sol --print call-graph

To visualise the graph:

dot -Tpng NameOfTheContract.sol.NameOfTheContract.call-graph.dot -o slithercallgraph.png

```

# Inheritance Graph: Output a graph showing the inheritance interaction between the contracts.
```
slither /src/NameOfTheContract.sol --print inheritance-graph

dot -Tpng NameOfTheContract.sol.inheritance-graph.dot -o slitherinheritancegraph.png

```
